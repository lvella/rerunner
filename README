This tiny program will run a command and will restart it every time the
child process terminates. May be useful to run programs you believe must
never die. Beware many daemons fork themselves at very beginning, let the
original process die, and keep the execution on the fork. If rerunner is
used on such daemons, it will detect the early death of the original
process and will keep on spawning it forever, possibly using up all
system memory until the computer freezes when swapping to death.

To build:

$ make

To run:

$ ./rerunner command [args]

Once running, the only way I know to kill your command, is to kill
the rerunner process first. If on a terminal, simply pressing CTRL+C
will do.
